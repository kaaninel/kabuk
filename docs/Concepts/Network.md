The Kabuk system relies on a robust and flexible networking architecture to enable seamless communication and collaboration between devices, agents, and users. This page provides an overview of the key networking concepts and technologies used in Kabuk.

### **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**

Kabuk uses a virtual private network (VPN) to provide a secure and encrypted connection between devices and the Kabuk network. The VPN ensures that all data transmitted between devices and the network is protected from unauthorized access and eavesdropping. The Kabuk VPN is based on a decentralized architecture, allowing devices to connect to each other directly and securely, without the need for a central server. For initial development wireguard will be used. 

### **Mesh**

The Kabuk network is built on a mesh topology, which allows devices to connect to each other in a decentralized and self-organizing manner. In a mesh network, each device acts as a node that can relay data to other nodes, allowing data to be transmitted efficiently and reliably, even in the presence of network failures or disruptions. The mesh topology provides several benefits, including:

- **Improved resilience**: The network can continue to function even if some nodes fail or are disconnected.
- **Increased scalability**: New devices can be added to the network without affecting the overall performance.
- **Enhanced security**: The decentralized nature of the mesh network makes it more difficult for attackers to compromise the entire network.

### **Relay**

The Kabuk network utilizes a relay server architecture to ensure seamless communication between devices and agents, even when the target node is offline. Relay servers act as intermediaries, caching encrypted information intended for offline nodes and relaying it to the target node when it reconnects to the network. This approach enables devices and agents to communicate with each other efficiently, without being hindered by intermittent connectivity or offline periods. By caching encrypted data, relay servers provide a secure and reliable means of storing and forwarding information, ensuring that messages are delivered to their intended recipients as soon as they come online. This design allows the Kabuk network to maintain a high level of availability and responsiveness, even in environments with limited or unreliable connectivity.

### **Ownership**

Ownership is a fundamental concept in the Kabuk network, as it defines the relationships between devices, agents, and resources. In Kabuk, ownership is established through a certificate-based system, utilizing asymmetric encryption to ensure secure and verifiable authentication. Each device is assigned to a specific agent, which is considered the owner of that device. 

The owner agent has full control over the device, including the ability to configure its settings, manage its resources, and share it with other agents. This sharing mechanism allows owner agents to delegate access to their devices to other trusted agents, enabling collaborative use and management of resources. Moreover, consumable resources, such as storage or processing power, can be shared with other agents.

The use of asymmetric encryption ensures that ownership and access rights are securely verified, preventing unauthorized access or tampering with devices and resources. By providing a clear and secure framework for ownership and resource sharing, the Kabuk network enables agents to work together seamlessly, while maintaining the integrity and security of their devices and resources. This ownership model also enables agents to manage their devices and resources in a flexible and dynamic way, allowing them to adapt to changing needs and circumstances, and to make the most efficient use of the resources available to them.

### **Physical Connection**

Physical connection refers to the physical link between devices and the Kabuk network. The Kabuk network supports a variety of physical connection methods, including:

- **Wireless connections**: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other wireless protocols.
- **Wired connections**: Ethernet, USB, and other wired protocols.
- **Mobile networks**: Cellular networks, such as 4G and 5G.

The physical connection method used by a device determines its connectivity and accessibility, as well as its ability to participate in the Kabuk network. The Kabuk network is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing devices to connect and communicate with each other using a variety of physical connection methods.

In summary, the Kabuk network should provide a robust and flexible networking architecture that enables seamless communication and collaboration between devices, agents, and users. 

### **Virtual Connection**

In the Kabuk network, virtual connection refers to the software layer that enables communication between devices. At the heart of this layer is gRPC, a high-performance communication protocol that facilitates efficient and reliable data exchange between devices. To ensure consistency and clarity in data representation, Kabuk utilizes RDF Schema to define types and structures for data exchange. This gRPC layer is built on top of the Mesh network, which establishes peer-to-peer connections between devices through a secure VPN. By combining gRPC and RDF Schema, Kabuk's virtual connection provides a robust and flexible framework for device communication, allowing devices to exchange data and collaborate seamlessly, while maintaining the security and integrity of the network. This architecture enables Kabuk to provide a scalable, efficient, and reliable platform for device interaction, paving the way for a wide range of innovative applications and use cases.
