In the Kabuk app, views serve as top-level pages that function like standalone apps, each catering to specific purposes such as media editing, messaging, explorer, and widget listing. Currently, the number of views is intentionally limited, but future development may introduce the ability for users to personalize their experience by customizing the number and types of views to suit their needs.
