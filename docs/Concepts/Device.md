A physical device in Kabuk is a hardware component that has limited resources and is owned by a user or an agent. Physical devices can be anything from smartphones and laptops to smart home devices and wearables.

## **Device Types**
Kabuk recognizes three types of devices: Main Device, Primary Device, and Secondary Device.

### **Main Device** | Primary Interaction Device
The Main Device is the user's primary device, which is typically their most desired device to interact with. This device is usually a smartphone or a tablet that the user carries around with them. The Main Device is responsible for managing important tasks and functions, and it is the primary point of interaction between the user and the Kabuk network.

### **Primary Device** | Agent Host
A Primary Device is a device that hosts agents and is physically connected to the Kabuk network. It runs the Kabuk software and can connect to Secondary Devices, managing and controlling them as needed. Primary Devices are typically more powerful than Secondary Devices and have the capability to run Kabuk.

### **Secondary Device** | Peripheral Device
A Secondary Device is a peripheral device that cannot run Kabuk but can be addressed and managed by a Primary Device through the Kabuk network. Examples of Secondary Devices include headphones, smart home devices, and other IoT devices. These devices can be controlled and managed by a Primary Device, but they do not have the capability to run Kabuk independently.

## **Device Characteristics**
All devices in Kabuk have the following characteristics:

- **Limited Resources**: Devices have limited processing power, memory, and storage capacity.
- **Ownership**: Devices are owned by a user or an agent, which has control over the device and its resources.
- **Connectivity**: Devices can connect to the Kabuk network, either directly or through a Primary Device.
