## **Schema**

The Kabuk network utilizes RDF Schema to define the structure and organization of data. RDF (Resource Description Framework) is a standard for representing data on the web, and RDF Schema provides a way to define the vocabulary and relationships between data elements. By using RDF Schema, Kabuk ensures that data is consistently represented and easily understandable by devices and agents, enabling seamless communication and collaboration.

### **Storage**

Kabuk uses SQLite as its primary storage solution. SQLite is a lightweight, self-contained, and serverless database that provides a reliable and efficient way to store and manage data. SQLite's flexibility and ease of use make it an ideal choice for Kabuk's decentralized and distributed architecture. Each device in the Kabuk network has its own SQLite database, which stores the device's local data and ensures that data is always available, even in offline mode.

### **Flow**

The flow of data in Kabuk refers to the way data is processed, transformed, and exchanged between devices and agents. Kabuk's flow is based on a stream-based architecture, where data is processed in real-time as it flows through the network. This approach enables Kabuk to provide a highly responsive and interactive experience, as data is always up-to-date and reflective of the current state of the network. The flow of data in Kabuk is also highly flexible, allowing devices and agents to define their own data processing pipelines and workflows.

### **Media**

Kabuk provides a robust media management system that enables devices and agents to store, manage, and exchange various types of media, such as images, videos, and audio files. The media system is built on top of the RDF Schema and SQLite storage, ensuring that media metadata is consistently represented and easily searchable. Kabuk's media system also provides a range of features, such as media transcoding, streaming, and playback, making it easy for devices and agents to work with media content.

### **Metadata**

Metadata is a critical component of the Kabuk network, as it provides context and meaning to the data being exchanged between devices and agents. Kabuk's metadata system is based on RDF Schema, which provides a standardized way of representing metadata. The metadata system stores information about the data, such as its type, format, and relationships to other data elements. This metadata is used to enable features such as search, filtering, and recommendation, making it easy for devices and agents to discover and interact with relevant data. Kabuk's metadata system is also highly extensible, allowing devices and agents to define their own custom metadata vocabularies and schemas.
