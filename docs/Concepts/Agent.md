Agents are the fundamental entities that drive the Kabuk system. They are the actors that take actions, make decisions, and interact with the world around them. Every agent has its own unique characteristics, capabilities, and knowledge base, which is stored in a separate database. This knowledge base serves as the agent's memory, allowing it to learn, adapt, and evolve over time.

**Key Characteristics of Agents**

- **Autonomy**: Agents operate independently, making decisions based on their internal logic engine and knowledge base.
- **Distributed**: Agents can run on multiple devices, allowing them to be accessed and controlled from different locations.
- **Messaging-based Interaction**: Agents interact with each other, devices, and the network solely through messaging, ensuring a decoupled and scalable architecture.
- **Temporary Possession**: Authorized users can temporarily possess an agent, allowing them to influence its actions and decisions.

**Agent Components**

- **Knowledge Base**: A separate database that stores the agent's memory, including its routines, automations, logic engines, and messaging history.
- **Routines**: Pre-defined sequences of actions that an agent can execute in response to specific events or conditions.
- **Automations**: Automated workflows that an agent can trigger based on its internal logic engine and knowledge base.
- **Logic Engine**: A rules-based engine that enables an agent to make decisions and calculate its actions based on its knowledge base and incoming messages.
- **Messaging**: Agents communicate with each other and the system through a messaging system, which allows them to exchange information and coordinate actions.

**Agent Lifecycle**

- **Creation**: An agent is created when a user defines its knowledge base, routines, and automations.
- **Initialization**: The agent is initialized with its knowledge base and begins to execute its routines and automations.
- **Execution**: The agent consumes its inbox, processes incoming messages, and executes its internal logic engine to calculate its actions.
- **Possession**: An authorized user can temporarily possess the agent, influencing its actions and decisions.
- **Termination**: The agent is terminated when it is no longer needed or when its knowledge base is deleted.

**Agent Types**

- **User Agents**: Agents that are created and controlled by users, allowing them to interact with the system and other agents.
- **System Agents**: Agents that are created and controlled by the system, providing essential services and functionality.
- **Device Agents**: Agents that are embedded in devices, exposing host-native functionality to rest of the system and allowing devices to interact with the system and other agents.

**Security and Authorization**

- **Authorization**: Agents can only interact with each other and the system if they have the necessary permissions and authorizations.
- **Encryption**: Agent communication is encrypted to ensure confidentiality and integrity.
- **Access Control**: Agents can control access to their knowledge base and routines, ensuring that only authorized users and agents can modify or access their internal state.

By providing a comprehensive framework for agents, the Kabuk system enables a wide range of applications and use cases, from personal assistants to complex automation systems. The agent-based architecture allows for flexibility, scalability, and adaptability, making it an ideal foundation for building a robust and intelligent system.
